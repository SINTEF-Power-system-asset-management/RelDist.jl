# Relrad.jl
Relrad.jl is an open source tool for estimating the reliability of radially operated distribution grids.

The algorithm used by the tool is based on the RELRAD methodology [1]. For the sake of computer implementation the method was rewritten in terms of graph theory [2]. When the dataset used in [2] has been published the data for reproducing the results from [2] will be included in the examples folder.
