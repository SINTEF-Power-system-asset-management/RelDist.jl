"""
NFC are loads that have no cost of disconnecting. This really means we just skip them,
but by changing the cost function we can choose to take them into account. By default
we use them as a tie-breaker, such that if two states are equal otherwise we include the
NFC load in the networkpart (without reducing the rest power)

NFC is short for Non-Firm Connection (norsk: tilknytting med vilk√•r)
