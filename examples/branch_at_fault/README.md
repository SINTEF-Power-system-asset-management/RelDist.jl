# Branch at fault case

Note [] means a switch

```txt
           bf
           |
          [] 
mf []--- load []--- bf
          []
           |
           bf
```

Every single of the backup feeders should be able to supply the load, but because the load isn't protected from the fault it cant be supplied.
